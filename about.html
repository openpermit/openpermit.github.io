  <p class="lead">
      Open Permit is a set of technologies aimed to provide open and standardized electronic interaction with permitting agencies within 
      jurisdictions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Traditionally permitting processes have been very manual and paper intensive and vary widely accross jurisdictions. Permitting requirements are
    usually provided by each jurisdiction through their web site, on paper or by phone, often with different points of contact for each specific
    requirement that needs to be met. Just obtaining accurate information about the specific permit requirements applicable to a project can be very
    time consuming for citizens and businesses. Going through the different steps needed to obtain a permit is often not only extremelly
    time consuming, but error prone, expensive and paper intensive.
  </p>
  <p>
    These problems compound when multiple jurisdictions are involved because despite the fact that many regulations enforced by permits are very similar
    accross jurisdictions, the processes followed to enforce them are very inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. It is often very costly for
    citizens and businesses to comply with permitting regulations and this slows economic development.
  </p>
  <p>
    Open Permit uses the internet to make the permitting process transparent by employing modern technology to define a set of open standards that allow
    a jurisdiction to publish information and interact with citizens and businesses through an electronic medium. This means that requirements and process
    details can be provided by jurisdictions in a machine readable and automated form, eliminating paper based workflows. An open standards model also allows for multiple
    jurisdictions to follow the same best practice approaches, minimizing inconsistencies when citizens go to obtain a permit from one jurisdiction to the
    next. Open Permit is also about making the technology itself open so that applications can be built in a way that are interoperable and can be used to
    streamline, automate and better visualize permitting. 
  </p>

<!-- Grid system
================================================== -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <h1 id="grid" class="page-header">Open Technology</h1>

  <p class="lead">Open Permit defines a standardized protocol and data format for interacting with permit processes.</p>

  <p>
      Currently, most jurisdictions keep track of permitting workflow information electronically. However, very few jurisdictions allow their applicants 
      to submit permit requirements or pay fees online. Even those that provide these capabilities usually only allow certain types of permits to be 
      processed over the internet. When it comes to plan review, it is mostly being done the same way that has been done for many decades, that is on paper. 
      Only a few early adopters review plans electronically, and many of the ones that do, still require applicants to deliver plans on an offline
      medium or have a set of cumbersome submittal requirements that discourage applicants from submitting online. For example, a common workflow
      for current electronic plan review follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Applicant creates plans in their favorite design software.</li>
    <li>Applicant plots plans on paper only to apply raised seal and deliver to jurisdiction.</li>
    <li>Jurisdiction scans plans to import into their electronic system.</li>
    <li>Jurisdiction reviews plans and provides comments electronically.</li>
    <li>This repeats for every revision to the plans.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  The previous workflow example is a big improvement over paper based plan review, but still has many unnecessary inefficiencies. First the applicant needs to spend potentially large sums of money printing the plans
  and drive or pay a courier service to deliver them. Then the jurisdiction needs to own or lease expensive large format scanners and employ
  personnel just to scan a set of plans. Needless to say this could be done more efficiently in this day and age, when most transactions are done
  online. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Open Permit not only aims to convert all permitting process steps to be electronic, but it also seeks to eliminate these types of "artificial" inefficiencies
  that get created when standards simply don&rsquo;t exist and open innovation can not fill the gap. By establishing a set of open protocols and
  data formats for accomplishing the different tasks involved in the permitting process, bad practices can be eliminated before a process is put
  in place or existing processes can be modified to follow best practices. 
  </p>
  <p>
   Open Permit is not the first specification that seeks to demonstrate the validity of the open standards approach. The Internet itself is an open standard
   and this openess is what has allowed it to become such a powerfull platform. In the government services space <a href="http://www.open311.org">Open311</a>
   has parallel goals to Open Permit, but for 311 services. In fact, many of the <a href="http://www.open311.org">Open311</a> ideas inspired the creation of
   Open Permit and we plan collaborate with, reuse or reference the <a href="http://www.open311.org">Open311</a> specification where possible to minimize redundant
   effort. To quote <a href="http://www.open311.org">Open311</a>: Open data and open standards are all about increasing the potential of good ideas, 
   empowering citizens, and allowing cities to do more with less.

  <h1 id="type" class="page-header">Benefits</h1>
  <p class="lead">
      By offering standard web API access to permitting services and open data formats, jurisdictions can greatly reduce the costs associated with
      government regulation for citizens, businesses and themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
  A standard API and open data formats means that a software ecosystem can be formed around these platforms. Small startups can afford to come in and start creating
  innovative applications on top of a common platform. Everyone can then benefit from new innovations built from a common foundation. For example, if a
  developer creates a new mobile application for contractors to interact with the City of Miami, it should also work with any other city so that the busy
  contractor does not have to provide credentials to each of the cities or attend training on how to use each city's system. Just as you can choose
  to buy a vacation package including airline tickets, hotel and rental car, all from Expedia or Travelocity; you should be able to pull all your permits in
  one place and keep track of them all at once. Similar benefits also apply to jurisdictions. An open standard allows their internal systems to be more
  interoperable and it doesn&rsquo;t lock them into any one system. Jurisdictions also benefit from vendor increased competition and new entrants to market,
  which leads to lower prices and incresed innovation.  
  </p>
  <p>
  According to the <a href="http://www.natlpartnerstreamline.org">ALLIANCE FOR BUILDING REGULATORY REFORM IN THE DIGITAL AGE</a> a non profit organization dedicated
  to create public / private partnerships to streamline construction. Streamlining building permits will (and we quote):  
  </p>
  <ul>
	<li>
	Stimulate economic recovery and community sustainability by annually saving the public and private sectors over $30 billion in unnecessary construction costs due to regulatory duplication, time delays and other inefficiencies by reducing between 50 and 70% the amount of time it takes to move construction projects through the regulatory system. This effort will get buildings open faster thus enabling communities to both increase employment and get buildings on the tax rolls faster.
	</li>
	<li>
	Create greater enforcement uniformity enabling state and local governments to make effective use of information technology to link and use 3 & 4 D building design and operation technologies and other data generated by the building design, construction and building operation and maintenance communities.
	</li>
	<li>
	Create greater code and enforcement uniformity enabling state and local governments to work together on a regional basis to better plan, train, mitigate, respond to and more rapidly recover from man-made and natural disasters.
	</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Another benefit that is often overlooked is the impact that these inneficient and paper heavy processes have on the environment. Paper plans are large
   and need to be printed, delivered and stored by the jurisdiction. Likely millions of trees would be saved by moving to an electronic process. Electronic
   permitting could also lead to sizable benefits to the environment due the elimination of millions of miles driven to deliver plans accross all jurisdictions,
   elimination of energy wasted on climatization of room space needed to store the plans and reduction in use of potential polutants such as ink.  
  </p>
  <p>
   Open Permit can be the underling platform that helps realize the goal of streamlined permitting and plan check.
