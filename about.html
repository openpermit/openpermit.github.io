  <p class="lead">
      Open Permit is a set of technologies aimed to provide open and standardized electronic interaction with permitting agencies within 
      jurisdictions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Traditionally permitting processes have been very manual and paper intensive and vary widely accross jurisdictions. Permitting requirements are
    usually provided by each jurisdiction through their web site, on paper or by phone, often with different points of contact for each specific
    requirement that needs to be met. Just obtaining accurate information about the specific permit requirements applicable to a project can be very
    time consuming for citizens and businesses small and large. Going through the different steps needed to obtain a permit is often not only extremelly
    time consuming, but error prone, expensive and paper intensive.
  </p>
  <p>
    These problems compound when multiple jurisdictions are involved because despite the fact that many regulations enforced by permits are very similar
    accross jurisdictions, the processes followed to enforce them are very inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. It is often very costly for
    citizens and businesses to comply with permitting regulations and this slows economic development.
  </p>
  <p>
    Open Permit uses the internet to make the permitting process transparent by employing modern technology to define a set of open standards that allow
    a jurisdiction to publish information and interact with citizens and businesses through an electronic medium. This means that requirements and process
    details can be provided by jurisdictions in an automated fashion and paper based workflows are eliminated. This open standard model also allows for multiple
    jurisdictions to follow the same best practice approaches minimizing inconsistencies when citizens go to obtain a permit from one jurisdiction to the
    next. However, Open Permit isn&rsquo;t just about making permitting services electronic, it&rsquo;s also about making the technology itself open so that
    applications can be built that are interoperable and can be used to streamline, automate and better visualize permitting. 
  </p>

<!-- Grid system
================================================== -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <h1 id="grid" class="page-header">Open Technology</h1>

  <p class="lead">Open Permit defines a standardized protocol and data format for interacting with permit processes.</p>

  <p>
      Currently, most jurisdictions keep track of permitting workflow information electronically. However, very few jurisdictions allow their applicants 
      to submit permit requirements or pay fees online. Even those that provide this capabilities usually only allow certain types of permits to be processed
      in this fashion. When it comes to plan review, very few early adopters review plans electronically and many of the ones that do either don&rsquo;t 
      advertise it, still require applicants to deliver plans on an offline medium or have cumbersome requirements that they discourage applicants from 
      submitting electronically. A common workflow for current electronic plan review follows.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Applicant creates plans in their favorite design software.</li>
    <li>Applicant prints plans only to apply raised seal and deliver to jurisdiction.</li>
    <li>Jurisdiction scans plans to import into their electronic system.</li>
    <li>This repeats for every revision to the plans.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  Needless to say this could be done more efficiently in this day and age when most transactions are done online. First the applicant needs to spend 
  potentially large sums of money printing the plans and drive or pay a courier service to deliver the plans. Then the jurisdiction needs own or lease
  expensive large format scanners and employ personnel just to scan a set of plans.  
  </p>
  <p>
  Open Permit not only aims to convert all permitting processes to be electronic, but it also seeks to eliminate "artificial" inefficiencies that get
  created when standards simply don&rsquo;t exist and open innovation can not fill the gap. By establishing a set of open protocols and data formats for
  accomplishing a task, bad practices can be eliminated before a process is put in place or existing processes can be modified to follow best practices. 
  </p>
  <p>
  An open standard also means that a software ecosystem can be formed around these platforms. Small startups can afford to come in and start creating
  innovative applications on top of a common platform. Everyone can then benefit from new innovations built from a common foundation. For example, if a
  developer creates a new mobile application for contractors to interact with the City of Miami, it should also work with any other city so that the busy
  contractor does not have to provide credentials to each of the cities or attend training on how to apply for a permit on each city. Just as you can choose
  to buy a ticket from an airline and a hotel all from Expedia or Travelocity and build an itinerary, you should be able to pull all your permits in
  one place and keep track of them all at once. Similar benefits also apply to jurisdictions. An open standard allows their internal systems to be more
  interoperable and it doesn&rsquo;t lock them into any one system.  
  </p>
  <p>
   Open Permit is not the first specification that seeks to demonstrate the validity of the open standards approach. The Internet itself is an open standard
   and this openess is what it has allowed it to become such a powerfull tool. In the government services space <a href="http://www.open311.org">Open311</a>
   has parallel goals to Open Permit but for 311 services. In fact, many of the <a href="http://www.open311.org">Open311</a> ideas inspired the creation of
   Open Permit and we plan collaborate with, reuse or reference the <a href="http://www.open311.org">Open311</a> spec where possible to minimize redundant
   effort. To quote <a href="http://www.open311.org">Open311</a>: Open data and open standards are all about increasing the potential of good ideas, 
   empowering citizens, and allowing cities to do more with less.

<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <h1 id="type" class="page-header">Benefits</h1>
  <p class="lead">
      By offering free web API access to permitting services, jurisdictions can greatly reduce the costs associated with government regulation for 
      citizens, businesses and themselves.</p>
  <p>
  According to the <a href="http://www.natlpartnerstreamline.org">ALLIANCE FOR BUILDING REGULATORY REFORM IN THE DIGITAL AGE</a> a non profit organization dedicated
  to create public / private partnerships to streamline construction. Streamlining building permits will (and we quote):  
  </p>
  <ul>
	<li>
	Stimulate economic recovery and community sustainability by annually saving the public and private sectors over $30 billion in unnecessary construction costs due to regulatory duplication, time delays and other inefficiencies by reducing between 50 and 70% the amount of time it takes to move construction projects through the regulatory system. This effort will get buildings open faster thus enabling communities to both increase employment and get buildings on the tax rolls faster.
	</li>
	<li>
	Create greater enforcement uniformity enabling state and local governments to make effective use of information technology to link and use 3 & 4 D building design and operation technologies and other data generated by the building design, construction and building operation and maintenance communities.
	</li>
	<li>
	Create greater code and enforcement uniformity enabling state and local governments to work together on a regional basis to better plan, train, mitigate, respond to and more rapidly recover from man-made and natural disasters.
	</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Another benefit that is often overlooked is the impact that these inneficient and paper heavy processes have on the environment. Paper plans are large and need to be printed, delivered and stored by the jurisdiction. Likely millions of trees would be saved by moving to an electrinic process. Eliminating miles driven to deliver plans and climatization of room space neeed to store the plans accross a jurisdiction, let alone accross the whole US, could amount to sizable reductions in green house emmissions.  
  </p>
  <p>
   Open Permit can be the underling platform that helps realize the goal of streamlined permitting and plan check.
