  <h1 id="overview" class="page-header">Overview</h1>

  <p class="lead">Open Permit is a set of technologies aimed to provide open and standardized electronic interaction with permitting agencies within jurisdictions.</p>

  <p>
  Traditionally permitting processes have been very manual and paper intensive and vary widely accross jurisdictions. Permitting requirements are usually provided by each jurisdiction through their web site, on paper or by phone, often with different points of contact for each specific requirement that needs to be met or step involved. Just obtaining accurate information about the specific permit requirements applicable to a project can be very time consuming for citizens and businesses alike. Going through the different steps needed to obtain a permit is often not only extremelly time consuming, but error prone, expensive and paper intensive.
  </p>
  <p>
  These problems compound when multiple jurisdictions are involved because despite the fact that many regulations enforced by permits are very similar accross jurisdictions, the processes followed to enforce them are very inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Often it is very costly for citizens and businesses to
  comply with permitting regulations and this discourages economic development.
  </p>
  <p>
  Open Permit uses the internet to make the permitting process transparent by employing modern technology to define a set of open standards that allow a jurisdiction to publish information and interact with citizens and businesses through an electronic medium. This means that requirements and process details can be provided by jurisdictions in an automated fashion and paper based workflows are eliminated. This open standard model allows for multiple jurisdictions to follow the same best practice approaches eliminating the problem of inconsistencies when citizens go to obtain a permit from one jurisdiction to the next. Yet Open Permit isn&rsquo;t just about making permitting services electronic, it&rsquo;s also about making the technology itself open so that applications can be built that are interoperable and can be used to streamline, automate and better visualize permitting.

<!-- Grid system
================================================== -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <h1 id="grid" class="page-header">Open Technology</h1>

  <p class="lead">Open Permit defines a standardized protocol and data format for interacting with permit processes.</p>

  <p>Currently, most jurisdictions keep track of permitting workflow information electronically. However, very few allow their applicants to submit permit requirements electronically or pay for fees online and even those that do usually only allow it for certain types of permits only. Needless to say this could be done more efficiently in this day and age when most transactions are done online. When it comes to plan review, very few early adopters review plans electronically and the ones that do either don&rsquo;t advertise it, require applicants to deliver plans on an offline medium or have so many requirements to submit electronically that they discourage applicants from doing so. A common workflow for current electronic plan review follows.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Applicant creates plans in their favorite design software.</li>
    <li>Applicant prints plans only to apply raised seal and deliver to jurisdiction.</li>
    <li>Jurisdiction scans plans to import into their electronic system.</li>
    <li>This repeats for every revision to the plans.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  Needless to say the above workflow is not only inefficient, but wastefull for both the jurisdiction and applicant. First the applicant needs to spend potentially
  large sums of money printing the plans and drive or pay a courier service to deliver the plans. Then the jurisdiction needs own or lease expensive large format scanners and employ personnel just to scan a set of plans.  
  </p>
  <p>
  Open Permit not only aims to convert all permitting processes to be electronic, but it also seeks to eliminate "artificial" inefficiencies that get created when 
  standards simply don&rsquo;t exist and open innovation can not fill the gap. By establishing a set of open protocols and data formats for accomplishing a task,
  bad practices are eliminated before a process is put in place. 
  </p>
  <p>
  An open standard also means that a software ecosystem can be formed around these platforms. Small startups can afford to come in and start creating innovative applications on top of a common platform rather than consultants dedicated to meeting each requirements for each city. Everyone can then benefit from new innovations built from a common foundation. When a developer creates a new application for contractors to interact with the City of Miami, it should also work with Miami-Dade County, the busy contractor shouldn&rsquo;t have to providing credentials to each of the jurisdiction or attending training for a given process. Just as you can chose among many different Twitter applications and many different web browsers, you should be able to choose (or to create) the best application to interact with your jurisdiction. These same benefits also apply to the jurisdiction. An open standard allows their internal systems to be more interoperable and it doesn&rsquo;t lock them into any one system.  
  </p>
  <p>
   Open Permit is not the first specification that seeks to demonstrate the validity of the open standards approach. The Internet is an open standard and in the government services space <a href="http://www.open311.org">Open311</a> has parallel goals but for 311 services. In fact, many of the <a href="http://www.open311.org">Open311</a> ideas inspired the creation of Open Permit and we plan collaborate with, reuse or reference the <a href="http://www.open311.org">Open311</a> spec where possible to minimize redundant effort. To quote <a href="http://www.open311.org">Open311</a>: Open data and open standards are all about increasing the potential of good ideas, empowering citizens, and allowing cities to do more with less.

<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <h1 id="type" class="page-header">Benefits</h1>
  <p class="lead">By offering free web API access to permitting services, jurisdictions can greatly reduce the costs associated with government regulation for government, citizens and businesses alike.</p>
  <p>
  According to the <a href="http://www.natlpartnerstreamline.org">ALLIANCE FOR BUILDING REGULATORY REFORM IN THE DIGITAL AGE</a> a non profit organization dedicated
  to create public / private partnerships to streamline construction. Streamlining building permits will (and we quote):  
  </p>
  <ul>
	<li>
	Stimulate economic recovery and community sustainability by annually saving the public and private sectors over $30 billion in unnecessary construction costs due to regulatory duplication, time delays and other inefficiencies by reducing between 50 and 70% the amount of time it takes to move construction projects through the regulatory system. This effort will get buildings open faster thus enabling communities to both increase employment and get buildings on the tax rolls faster.
	</li>
	<li>
	Create greater enforcement uniformity enabling state and local governments to make effective use of information technology to link and use 3 & 4 D building design and operation technologies and other data generated by the building design, construction and building operation and maintenance communities.
	</li>
	<li>
	Create greater code and enforcement uniformity enabling state and local governments to work together on a regional basis to better plan, train, mitigate, respond to and more rapidly recover from man-made and natural disasters.
	</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Another benefit that is often overlooked is the impact that these inneficient and paper heavy processes have on the environment. Paper plans are large and need to be printed, delivered and stored by the jurisdiction. Likely millions of trees would be saved by moving to an electrinic process. Eliminating miles driven to deliver plans and climatization of room space neeed to store the plans accross a jurisdiction, let alone accross the whole US, could amount to sizable reductions in green house emmissions.  
  </p>
  <p>
   Open Permit can be the underling platform that helps realize the goal of streamlined permitting and plan check.
