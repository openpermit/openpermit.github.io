##OpenPermit Specification##

The OpenPermit Specification presents permit information, requirements, application details and other relevant permit process information in a unified and standardized format. The API also covers operations for permit processes such as applying for a permit, submitting requirements (i.e. documents, construction plans, etc.) and retrieving permit status information. These APIs will allow developers to build applications to streamline, automate and help visualize different aspects of the permitting process in jurisdictions.

The OpenPermit API defines a large set of operations with the aim to support all parts of the permitting process in a jurisdiction. However, moving the entire permitting process to be electronic, all in one shot, could be quite a big task, not to mention too disruptive for many jurisdictions. We expect that many jurisdictions will not implement the entire specification in one pass, but they will gradually move part of their permitting workflows to be electronic. To this end, we have tried to divide the API into sections that can be implemented in isolation and will allow for gradual adoption of OpenPermit. These sections have been aligned with specific services that can be offered by a jurisdiction individually, but could also all be part of a 100% electronic permitting process.
